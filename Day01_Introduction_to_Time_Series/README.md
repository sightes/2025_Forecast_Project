# Day 01: Introduction to Time Series 📊

## Learning Objectives 🎯
- Understand what time series data is
- Identify different components of time series
- Learn about different types of time series patterns
- Get familiar with basic time series visualization

## Theory 📚

### What is Time Series Data?
Time series data is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at regular time intervals. Examples include:
- Daily stock prices 📈
- Monthly sales data 💰
- Hourly temperature readings 🌡️
- Weekly website traffic 📱

### Components of Time Series
1. **Trend** 📈
   - Long-term movement in the data
   - Can be increasing, decreasing, or stable

2. **Seasonality** 🔄
   - Repeating patterns at regular intervals
   - Examples: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly patterns

3. **Cyclical** 🔁
   - Patterns that occur at irregular intervals
   - Not fixed like seasonality
   - Example: business cycles

4. **Residual/Noise** 📊
   - Random variations in the data
   - Cannot be explained by trend, seasonality, or cycles

### Types of Time Series Patterns
1. **Stationary** ⚖️
   - Mean, variance, and covariance remain constant over time
   - No trend or seasonality

2. **Non-Stationary** 📉
   - Contains trend and/or seasonality
   - More common in real-world data

3. **Seasonal** 🌸
   - Contains regular patterns that repeat at fixed intervals

4. **Trend** 📈
   - Shows a consistent upward or downward movement

## Practice Exercises 🎯

### Exercise 1: Basic Time Series Creation
Create a simple time series using pandas and visualize it.

### Exercise 2: Component Identification
Given a time series dataset, identify its components (trend, seasonality, etc.).

### Exercise 3: Pattern Recognition
Analyze different types of time series patterns in real-world data.
